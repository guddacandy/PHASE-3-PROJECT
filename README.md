# PREDICTION OF SYRIATEL CUSTOMER CHURN

## Business Overview

The telecommunications company Telecom has amassed information about its clients and whether or not they have churned—that is, ceased doing business with Telecom. In the cutthroat world of telecom providers, keeping customers is crucial. Most Americans—more than 95%—already have a cell phone. Furthermore, the expense of obtaining new clients can surpass that of keeping hold of current ones by a factor of 25. To lower customer attrition rates, telecommunications companies use big data analytics to analyse data on usage, customer accounts, demographics, connectivity, network performance and dependability, customer support and service issues, and more. Telecommunications companies need to be able to predict customer churn in order to effectively retain customers. Large telecom companies are therefore working to create models that can identify which of their customers are most likely to act and change.

## Data Understanding
This project utilises data from the Churn in Telecom dataset from Kaggle.
The target variable in this dataset that we aimed to predict was identified as the churn column.
The features of this dataset include locational information (state and area_code) as well as plan details such as call minutes, charges, customer services calls and whether the customer had an international plan and/or voice mail plan. Our model iterations utilised subsets of these features as well as aggregations of these features to determine which features would best predict cusomter churn.

## Business understanding
Business problem
For telecommunication companies to grow their revenue generating base, it is key to attract new customers and at the same time increase customer retention rate. Customer churn is one of the most important concerns for large companies. Customer churn is a metric showing when a subscriber or a regular customer cancels his subscription or stops doing business with a company. Churn could be due to various factors, including switching to a competitor for better price offers, cancelling their subscription because of poor customer service, or discontinuing all contact with a brand due to insufficient touchpoints.
Syriatel is a provider of mobile telecommunication and data services based in Damascus, Syria. The company offers services including calls, news, message, GSM and internet services. It has successfully established its reputation by focusing on customer satisfaction and social responsibility. Syriatel has established that long-term relationships with customers are more effective than trying to attract new customers. To them, working to keep a client is cheaper than working to get a new client. Churn prediction has therefore become a very important part of the company's strategy. This project aims to develop a model which accurately predicts customers who are most likely to churn, and identify the features that are important for predicting customer churn. Syriatel can thus act to prevent the customer who is likely to churn from actually churning.




### EDA
## CONCLUSION
This project entails a business overview, business understanding, data understanding, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and recommendation in order to advise Telecom on the best procedures. The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology showing the various project stages in the proper format. This project is integral to Telecom as it will provide the best model which will be able to predict customers likely to churn and therefore, equip the company with data on customers likely to churn in order for the company to take appropriate action. In conclusion, when customers leave, they are going to the competition. Understanding churn factors will not only allow Telecom to understand why their customers are leaving but also to what extent the factors that lead to customer dissatisfaction affect the company. Overall, this will lead to the opportunity for Telecom to sharpen its attractiveness in the eyes of its customers by competing in the market well.

## RECOMMENDATION

The telecom company should conduct further research to ensure their heavy daytime minute user, international plan users, and customers who call customer service are satisfied with their service.
Syriatel should ensure effective customer service so as to meet customers' expectations and analyze customer interactions. They can then follow up on both positive and negative feedbacks received.
The more the number of minutes the customer spends on the phone, the higher the likelihood of not churning. The company should look into the call charge rates in comparison to the competitors, and consider if they should lower the charges of calls per minute. This can prevent other customers from churning.
